This theory aims to explain \\nthe state that is simultaneously social and material in the world (Kim & Yang, 2020).  \\nTraditionally, the distinct and direct use of technology in societies was either ab sent or only \\nimplicitly discussed. The separation of technology and organisation of societies was \\nparadoxical and problematic due to the rising importance of technologies in transforming \\nexisting and shaping new social norms and structures (Jain & Srinivasan, 2022; Orlikowski & \\nScott, 2008; Stanko, Dahm, Lahneman, & Richter, 2022) . Therefore, the socio -materiality \\ntheory gained momentum as a theoretical view that replaces the separation of technologies \\nfrom societies with a fusion of them  (Orlikowski & Scot t, 2008) . In this way, the socio -\\nmateriality perspective rests on the premise that social and technological aspects of various \\nsocial systems and phenomena are interlinked and inseparable in a given context. This \\ninseparability creates constitutive entangl ement and recursive intertwining which creates \\nunique forces for the system to adapt and evolve (Jain & Srinivasan, 2022). Therefore, a socio-\\nmaterialistic view of a given social or organisational phenomenon suggests that all materiality \\nis created, interpreted, and used based on social practice, and all social practice is affected \\nby materiality (Leonardi, 2013). We now use this view to propose a socio-materialistic view of \\ndigital nomadism.  \\n \\n A socio-materialistic view of digital nomadism and why it matters \\nIn a socio-materialistic view, materiality refers to the qualities of material agencies including \\nall technological tools, methods, techniques and essentially all non -human elements \\nperforming specific functions. Considering this, the digital and physi cal aspects of a digital \\nnomadic lifestyle form the inseparable materialistic fabric of it.

In the context of digital \\nnomadism, the human-centric of a nomadic life and the way a nomad organises his or her life \\nwhile balancing it with work constitute social practice. These includes routines, norms, policies, \\ncommunications and personal as well as professional activities that are crucial to perform jobs \\nand sustain the nomadic lifestyle. Taken together, a socio -materialistic view of digital \\nnomadism suggests that digital and non -digital tools and technologies as well as human -\\ncantered agency and different policies and behaviours work in tandem to create a  \\nreconciliation of work -specific requirements with the necessary conditions of a nomadic \\nlifestyle.   \\nThis view is important in two ways. First, it portrays digital nomadism as a complex system of \\nsocial and material factors which work together in order to create a unique lifestyle. This view \\nis, therefore, a theoretically robust approach to study different aspects of digital nomadism. \\nSecond, it offers three intertwined directions to study the formation, functionality, and \\nconsequences of adopting digitally nomadic lifestyle. These three include, the materiality side, \\nthe social practice, and the fusion of these two in the form of a unified socio -materialistic \\nphenomenon. \\n \\nConclusion   \\nDigital nomadism has become one of the most talked-about buzz words recently. Despite its \\nrising popularity, little research has been done on the theoretical foundation of this \\nphenomenon. In this short essay we used the theoretical lens of socio -materiality and \\nproposed a socio-materialistic view of digital nomadism. We argued that the technological and \\nsocial sides of digital nomadism can’t be separated.  We also outlined why this view matters. \\nWe hope other researchers interested in this phenomenon see benefits in this approach and \\nbuild on our conceptualization to advance research on this interesting phenomenon.'),\n",

As such, digital nomads are also called “ neo-nomads,” \\n“global nomads,” “modern nomads,” or “new nomads” (Müller, 2016).  \\nThe lifestyle of th e digital nomad unifies different aspects of  multi-directional technology -\\nenabled mobility and location-independent work on a new social level that may lead to a new \\nglobal culture or a universal social system (Bozzi, 2020; Ibarra & Kalich, 2022; Müller, 2 016; \\nWoldoff & Litchfield, 2021) . As such, a deeper understanding of the genesis of digital \\nnomadism is warranted. To this end, we can distinguish two forces that play pivotal role in the \\nformation of digital nomadism: 1) digital technology 2) socio -cultural style of a nomadic life. \\nThe question is, then, how these forces come together to explain the genesis of digital \\nnomadism? \\n \\nSocio-materiality theoryThe socio-materiality theory is a theory of the interaction between technology (material) and \\norganisation of societies in which different technologies are used. This theory aims to explain \\nthe state that is simultaneously social and material in the world (Kim & Yang, 2020).  \\nTraditionally, the distinct and direct use of technology in societies was either ab sent or only \\nimplicitly discussed. The separation of technology and organisation of societies was \\nparadoxical and problematic due to the rising importance of technologies in transforming \\nexisting and shaping new social norms and structures (Jain & Srinivasan, 2022; Orlikowski & \\nScott, 2008; Stanko, Dahm, Lahneman, & Richter, 2022) . Therefore, the socio -materiality \\ntheory gained momentum as a theoretical view that replaces the separation of technologies \\nfrom societies with a fusion of them  (Orlikowski & Scot t, 2008) . In this way, the socio -\\nmateriality perspective rests on the premise that social and technological aspects of various \\nsocial systems and phenomena are interlinked and inseparable in a given context. This \\ninseparability creates constitutive entangl ement and recursive intertwining which creates \\nunique forces for the system to adapt and evolve (Jain & Srinivasan, 2022). Therefore, a socio-\\nmaterialistic view of a given social or organisational phenomenon suggests that all materiality \\nis created, interpreted, and used based on social practice, and all social practice is affected \\nby materiality (Leonardi, 2013). We now use this view to propose a socio-materialistic view of \\ndigital nomadism.  \\n \\n A socio-materialistic view of digital nomadism and why it matters \\nIn a socio-materialistic view, materiality refers to the qualities of material agencies including \\nall technological tools, methods, techniques and essentially all non -human elements \\nperforming specific functions. Considering this, the digital and physi cal aspects of a digital \\nnomadic lifestyle form the inseparable materialistic fabric of it. Furthermore, materiality is not \\nlimited to only technical aspects of digital nomadism. The workplace and the physical \\nenvironment where a digital nomad is situated and works also constitutes as components ofits material identity. The social practice is however boarder and covers all human-enabled or \\nperformed agencies or routines that make a system functions. In the context of digital \\nnomadism, the human-centric of a nomadic life and the way a nomad organises his or her life \\nwhile balancing it with work constitute social practice. These includes routines, norms, policies, \\ncommunications and personal as well as professional activities that are crucial to perform jobs \\nand sustain the nomadic lifestyle. Taken together, a socio -materialistic view of digital \\nnomadism suggests that digital and non -digital tools and technologies as well as human -\\ncantered agency and different policies and behaviours work in tandem to create a  \\nreconciliation of work -specific requirements with the necessary conditions of a nomadic \\nlifestyle.   \\nThis view is important in two ways. First, it portrays digital nomadism as a complex system of \\nsocial and material factors which work together in order to create a unique lifestyle. This view \\nis, therefore, a theoretically robust approach to study different aspects of digital nomadism. \\nSecond, it offers three intertwined directions to study the formation, functionality, and \\nconsequences of adopting digitally nomadic lifestyle. These three include, the materiality side, \\nthe social practice, and the fusion of these two in the form of a unified socio -materialistic \\nphenomenon. \\n \\nConclusion   \\nDigital nomadism has become one of the most talked-about buzz words recently. Despite its \\nrising popularity, little research has been done on the theoretical foundation of this \\nphenomenon. In this short essay we used the theoretical lens of socio -materiality and \\nproposed a socio-materialistic view of digital nomadism. We argued that the technological and \\nsocial sides of digital nomadism can’t be separated.  We also outlined why this view matters. \\nWe hope other researchers interested in this phenomenon see benefits in this approach and \\nbuild on our conceptualization to advance research on this interesting phenomenon.References  \\n \\nBozzi, N.

       "['A Socio-Materialistic View of Digital Nomadism \\n \\nZahra Sadeghinejad \\nArash Najmaei \\n \\nSeptember 2022 \\n \\nDigital nomadism has become one of the most significant social phenomena in the last few \\nyears. Preponderance of scholarly and anecdotal evidence about the rise of digitally nomadic \\nlifer style and its role of transforming societies, markets, and industries suggest that this \\nphenomenon deserve more systematic explanation. To this end, we borrow the socio -\\nmateriality theory from the field of organisation scien ce to propose a socio-materialistic view \\nof digital nomadism. Our conceptualization suggests that digital nomadism is best understood \\nas a form of continuous emergent of social life of a nomad and through his or her use of digital \\nmaterial. The socio -materiality of digital nomadism hence offers a new view of the \\nphenomenon as an inseparable entity that is social and material. \\n \\nDefining digital nomadism  \\nNomads are people who move often to different locations. Traditionally, they were motivated \\nby the need to obtain food, find pasture for livestock, or otherwise make a living. While a grey \\nzone exists in defining nomads and migrants, nomads move more often or move continuously \\nas a lifestyle choice (Schlagwein, 2018). Among traditional nomads, we can distinguish hunter-\\ngatherers (moving in their search for food), pastoral nomads (moving with their livestock, such \\nas the Bedouin) and peripatetic nomads (moving to sell their craft, such as the Sinti) \\n(Schlagwein, 2018).  \\nDigital nomadism departs from these traditional forms by emphasizing the central role of digital \\ntechnologies and the need to seek digital freedom which is enabled by internet. In 1997,Makimoto and Manners recognised the power of internet in transforming lives in their \\nmanifesto called “digital nomad” in which they described the future of work as:  \\n“At the moment, we do not have the ability to communicate by video link between any \\ntwo points on the planet. But we will have it, and it will be generally affordable, within ten \\nyears. We will be able to see people, documents, and pictures wherever they happen to \\nbe, from anywhere we happen to be” (p. 5f). \\nFast forward 25 years, prophesy of Makimoto  and Manners has turned into a global reality. \\nDigital nomadism is the offspring of the freedom that global digital technology and its rapid \\nadvancement and widespread adoption brings about. As described by Reichenberger (2017) \\nfreedom in the information era appears “in a variety of contexts, including freedom within paid \\nemployment, freedom relating to location independence and freedom to pursue self -\\ndevelopment” (p. 9).

Considering this, the digital and physi cal aspects of a digital \\nnomadic lifestyle form the inseparable materialistic fabric of it. Furthermore, materiality is not \\nlimited to only technical aspects of digital nomadism. The workplace and the physical \\nenvironment where a digital nomad is situated and works also constitutes as components ofits material identity. The social practice is however boarder and covers all human-enabled or \\nperformed agencies or routines that make a system functions. In the context of digital \\nnomadism, the human-centric of a nomadic life and the way a nomad organises his or her life \\nwhile balancing it with work constitute social practice. These includes routines, norms, policies, \\ncommunications and personal as well as professional activities that are crucial to perform jobs \\nand sustain the nomadic lifestyle. Taken together, a socio -materialistic view of digital \\nnomadism suggests that digital and non -digital tools and technologies as well as human -\\ncantered agency and different policies and behaviours work in tandem to create a  \\nreconciliation of work -specific requirements with the necessary conditions of a nomadic \\nlifestyle.   \\nThis view is important in two ways. First, it portrays digital nomadism as a complex system of \\nsocial and material factors which work together in order to create a unique lifestyle. This view \\nis, therefore, a theoretically robust approach to study different aspects of digital nomadism. \\nSecond, it offers three intertwined directions to study the formation, functionality, and \\nconsequences of adopting digitally nomadic lifestyle. These three include, the materiality side, \\nthe social practice, and the fusion of these two in the form of a unified socio -materialistic \\nphenomenon. \\n \\nConclusion   \\nDigital nomadism has become one of the most talked-about buzz words recently. Despite its \\nrising popularity, little research has been done on the theoretical foundation of this \\nphenomenon. In this short essay we used the theoretical lens of socio -materiality and \\nproposed a socio-materialistic view of digital nomadism. We argued that the technological and \\nsocial sides of digital nomadism can’t be separated.  We also outlined why this view matters. \\nWe hope other researchers interested in this phenomenon see benefits in this approach and \\nbuild on our conceptualization to advance research on this interesting phenomenon.References  \\n \\nBozzi, N.

       "[Document(metadata={}, page_content='A Socio-Materialistic View of Digital Nomadism \\n \\nZahra Sadeghinejad \\nArash Najmaei \\n \\nSeptember 2022 \\n \\nDigital nomadism has become one of the most significant social phenomena in the last few \\nyears. Preponderance of scholarly and anecdotal evidence about the rise of digitally nomadic \\nlifer style and its role of transforming societies, markets, and industries suggest that this \\nphenomenon deserve more systematic explanation. To this end, we borrow the socio -\\nmateriality theory from the field of organisation scien ce to propose a socio-materialistic view \\nof digital nomadism. Our conceptualization suggests that digital nomadism is best understood \\nas a form of continuous emergent of social life of a nomad and through his or her use of digital \\nmaterial. The socio -materiality of digital nomadism hence offers a new view of the \\nphenomenon as an inseparable entity that is social and material. \\n \\nDefining digital nomadism  \\nNomads are people who move often to different locations. Traditionally, they were motivated \\nby the need to obtain food, find pasture for livestock, or otherwise make a living. While a grey \\nzone exists in defining nomads and migrants, nomads move more often or move continuously \\nas a lifestyle choice (Schlagwein, 2018). Among traditional nomads, we can distinguish hunter-\\ngatherers (moving in their search for food), pastoral nomads (moving with their livestock, such \\nas the Bedouin) and peripatetic nomads (moving to sell their craft, such as the Sinti) \\n(Schlagwein, 2018).  \\nDigital nomadism departs from these traditional forms by emphasizing the central role of digital \\ntechnologies and the need to seek digital freedom which is enabled by internet. In 1997,Makimoto and Manners recognised the power of internet in transforming lives in their \\nmanifesto called “digital nomad” in which they described the future of work as:  \\n“At the moment, we do not have the ability to communicate by video link between any \\ntwo points on the planet. But we will have it, and it will be generally affordable, within ten \\nyears. We will be able to see people, documents, and pictures wherever they happen to \\nbe, from anywhere we happen to be” (p. 5f). \\nFast forward 25 years, prophesy of Makimoto  and Manners has turned into a global reality. \\nDigital nomadism is the offspring of the freedom that global digital technology and its rapid \\nadvancement and widespread adoption brings about. As described by Reichenberger (2017) \\nfreedom in the information era appears “in a variety of contexts, including freedom within paid \\nemployment, freedom relating to location independence and freedom to pursue self -\\ndevelopment” (p. 9).  Digital nomads are, then those mobile laborers who seek a new mode \\nof work-life reconciliation (Müller, 2016) by adopting a nomadic lifestyle while working remotely \\nby leveraging digital technologies. As such, digital nomads are also called “ neo-nomads,” \\n“global nomads,” “modern nomads,” or “new nomads” (Müller, 2016).  \\nThe lifestyle of th e digital nomad unifies different aspects of  multi-directional technology -\\nenabled mobility and location-independent work on a new social level that may lead to a new \\nglobal culture or a universal social system (Bozzi, 2020; Ibarra & Kalich, 2022; Müller, 2 016; \\nWoldoff & Litchfield, 2021) . As such, a deeper understanding of the genesis of digital \\nnomadism is warranted. To this end, we can distinguish two forces that play pivotal role in the \\nformation of digital nomadism: 1) digital technology 2) socio -cultural style of a nomadic life. \\nThe question is, then, how these forces come together to explain the genesis of digital \\nnomadism? \\n \\nSocio-materiality theoryThe socio-materiality theory is a theory of the interaction between technology (material) and \\norganisation of societies in which different technologies are used. This theory aims to explain \\nthe state that is simultaneously social and material in the world (Kim & Yang, 2020).  \\nTraditionally, the distinct and direct use of technology in societies was either ab sent or only \\nimplicitly discussed. The separation of technology and organisation of societies was \\nparadoxical and problematic due to the rising importance of technologies in transforming \\nexisting and shaping new social norms and structures (Jain & Srinivasan, 2022; Orlikowski & \\nScott, 2008; Stanko, Dahm,'),\n",

Therefore, the socio -materiality \\ntheory gained momentum as a theoretical view that replaces the separation of technologies \\nfrom societies with a fusion of them  (Orlikowski & Scot t, 2008) . In this way, the socio -\\nmateriality perspective rests on the premise that social and technological aspects of various \\nsocial systems and phenomena are interlinked and inseparable in a given context. This \\ninseparability creates constitutive entangl ement and recursive intertwining which creates \\nunique forces for the system to adapt and evolve (Jain & Srinivasan, 2022). Therefore, a socio-\\nmaterialistic view of a given social or organisational phenomenon suggests that all materiality \\nis created, interpreted, and used based on social practice, and all social practice is affected \\nby materiality (Leonardi, 2013).
